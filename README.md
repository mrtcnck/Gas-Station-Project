# Gas-Station-Project

This project is my university graduation project. It was written using C#, Windows Form, ADO.NET. 

The main purpose of the project is to provide redirection from one login screen to multiple pages. 
There is a role-based membership system that I wrote myself. 
When the user logs in, the screen changes according to which role they are assigned. 
Our roles are admin, manager and user. 
The admin can view everything, change everything, update prices and assign managers. 
The manager can assign staff and make price updates. 
The user, on the other hand, defines the license plate and uploads the balance and uses the application.
